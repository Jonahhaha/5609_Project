# Global Earthquake Analysis: Visualizing Seismic Activity and High-Risk Zones with Processing

In this project, our team analyzed global earthquake occurrences to gain insights into their geographic distribution and intensity. Working collaboratively with two team members, I contributed significantly by generating visual representations of earthquake data and integrating them onto a global map. I leveraged data visualization techniques to illustrate the frequency and extensiveness of earthquakes across various regions, allowing for a clearer understanding of high-risk areas and seismic activity patterns.

Specifically, my role involved processing and refining raw data to produce high-quality images that highlighted critical aspects of earthquake intensity and spread. By overlaying these visuals on an interactive world map, I facilitated an accessible and visually compelling way to convey complex data trends. This approach not only underscored the widespread impact of earthquakes but also enabled the audience to identify potential correlations between geographic factors and seismic activity.

With my teamâ€™s consent, I am publishing this project on my GitHub to share our findings and methods with a broader audience. Our work aims to support ongoing research in seismic risk assessment and contribute to educational resources on global earthquake patterns.
